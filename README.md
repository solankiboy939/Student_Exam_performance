## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-exam-performance.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the model:

    ```bash
    python predict_performance.py
    ```

## Model Description

The Student Exam Performance Prediction Model utilizes a combination of supervised learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Gradient Boosting. It takes into account various features such as previous exam scores, study time, and socioeconomic background to predict student performance in exams.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is available in the `data` directory. It contains information about student demographics, study habits, and exam scores.

## ML Animation Code

Below is a sample code snippet demonstrating how you can visualize the predictions made by the model using matplotlib:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Sample data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

# Plotting
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Sine Wave')
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.show()
